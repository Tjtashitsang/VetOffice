This is an individual assignment. You will design the administration program for a veterinary office: This office attends 
to three different kinds of animals: Dogs, Birds, and Fish. You are to capture these with their respective classes. 
Each subclass of animals will have 5 different varieties. You are to define what those are for each kind of animal.

You should keep track, for every animal, the following information:

	Owner.
	Name of the animal.
	Age of the animal.
	Medical history: A list of diseases, and a status for each: current or past.
	A list of vaccinations, if applicable.
	Current appointments.
Appointments are their own entity, so this should captured with a class, containing date and time, and client.

You should also have a class for owners with information like name, address, and phone number.

Here's the functionality you must provide:

	See a list of all appointments, and change the status from outstanding to resolved. When an appointment is resolved, it is removed from the list.
	Search appointments by owner and by date.
	Search medical records by animal name, owner, and animal kind (like show all appointments for Dogs).
	From the screen of the record of a particular animal, check appointments, and add appointments.
	The whole registry can be saved and restored to/from a file.
	For all the search functionalities you are to implement it using a search function that uses a Java Comparator for each case 
	(say search(T[] list, Comparator<T> comp)). You are also required to handle all input problem on the UI (like the user entering 
	wrong kind of input, say a number instead of a letter) using Java's exception handling.

Follow the submission guidelines and submit compressed file on blackboard.

This assignment is worth 100 points.
